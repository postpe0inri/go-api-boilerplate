### Thrausi Object
 
The Thrausi object is the core element of the plugin. It allows you to apply fracture and destruction effects to any object in your scene. To create a Thrausi object, go to Plugins > Thrausi > Thrausi Object. You will see a new object in your object manager with a green icon. You can rename it as you like.
 
To use the Thrausi object, you need to drag and drop the object that you want to fracture into the "Object" field of the Thrausi object. You can use any type of object, such as a primitive, a spline, a polygonal mesh, or a generator. You can also use multiple objects by putting them into a null object or a group.
 
Once you have assigned an object to the Thrausi object, you can adjust the settings and parameters of the fracture and destruction effect. There are many options and modes that you can choose from, such as Voronoi, Spline, Radial, Slice, Cluster, etc. You can also control the number, size, shape, and distribution of the pieces, as well as the thickness, bevel, and material of the edges.
 
To preview the effect, you can click on the "Make Editable" button on the Thrausi object. This will convert the Thrausi object into a fracture object with all the pieces as child objects. You can then move, rotate, scale, or animate the pieces individually or as a group. You can also use other Cinema 4D tools and modifiers to further edit or refine the pieces.

### Thrausi Tag
 
The Thrausi tag is another feature of the plugin that allows you to apply fracture and destruction effects to an object based on collisions with other objects. To create a Thrausi tag, go to Plugins > Thrausi > Thrausi Tag. You will see a new tag in your tag manager with a green icon. You can rename it as you like.
 
To use the Thrausi tag, you need to drag and drop the object that you want to fracture into the "Object" field of the Thrausi tag. You also need to drag and drop another object that will act as a collider into the "Collider" field of the Thrausi tag. The collider can be any type of object that has dynamics enabled.
 
Once you have assigned an object and a collider to the Thrausi tag, you can adjust the settings and parameters of the fracture and destruction effect. There are similar options and modes as the Thrausi object, but with some additional features such as trigger mode, collision speed threshold, break force threshold, etc. You can also control how the pieces react to gravity, friction, bounce, etc.
 
To preview the effect, you need to play the animation in your timeline. You will see that when the collider hits the object with the Thrausi tag, it will break into pieces according to your settings. The pieces will then fall and interact with other objects in your scene based on their dynamics properties. You can also keyframe or animate the collider or other objects in your scene to create different scenarios.
