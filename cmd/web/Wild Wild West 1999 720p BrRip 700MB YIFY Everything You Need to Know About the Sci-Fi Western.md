West and Gordon end up fighting each other and McGrath's men, until they are arrested by U.S. Army Captain James T. West (Buck Taylor), who is Jim West's commanding officer. Captain West informs them that President Ulysses S. Grant (also played by Kevin Kline) wants them to work together to stop a mysterious villain named Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), who is plotting to overthrow the United States government with his army of steampunk contraptions.
 
West and Gordon board a special train called The Wanderer, which is equipped with various gadgets and weapons. They are joined by Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek), a woman who claims to be looking for her father, Professor Escobar (Rodrigo Santoro), who is one of the scientists kidnapped by Loveless. Along the way, they encounter Loveless and his henchmen, who use a giant mechanical spider, a flying machine, a tank and other devices to attack them.
 
West and Gordon discover that Loveless is a former Confederate scientist who lost half of his body in the war. He blames Grant for his condition and seeks revenge by creating a new nation called Lovelessland, which would consist of the former Confederate states and parts of Mexico and Canada. He invites Grant to his headquarters in Spider Canyon for peace talks, but intends to assassinate him and take over the country.
 
West and Gordon manage to infiltrate Loveless' lair and rescue Grant and the kidnapped scientists. They also learn that Rita is actually Loveless' wife, who was sent to spy on them. They engage in a final showdown with Loveless and his spider on top of a cliff, where they use their wits and skills to defeat him and save the day.
