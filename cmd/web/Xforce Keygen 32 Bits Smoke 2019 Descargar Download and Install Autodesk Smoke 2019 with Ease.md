Figure 2.8 illustrates a screenshot of a software tool called Cellebrite Analytics, which has been renamed as Cellebrite Pathfinder. This tool can analyze communication events that are extracted from a phone and construct a social graph that represents the relationships and interactions among the people involved in those events. The graph displays the names and icons of the communication participants, as well as the type and frequency of their communications over a certain period of time. The histogram at the bottom of the screenshot shows how the communication volume changes over time, indicating the patterns and trends of the social network.
