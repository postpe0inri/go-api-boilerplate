## The Myth of Expertise
 
One of the main themes of the book is the myth of expertise on Wall Street. Schwed shows that most of the so-called experts, such as analysts, economists, fund managers, and advisors, are not really experts at all. They are often biased, ignorant, incompetent, or dishonest. They do not have any special knowledge or skill that can help them predict the future or beat the market. They are mostly interested in selling their services and products to the gullible public.
 
Schwed advises investors to be skeptical and independent when dealing with Wall Street experts. He warns that they should not trust anyone who claims to have a secret formula, a sure-fire system, or a crystal ball. He also suggests that investors should do their own research and analysis, and rely on their own judgment and common sense. He says: "The most important thing for an investor is to have some idea of what he is doing."
 
## The Futility of Forecasting
 
Another theme of the book is the futility of forecasting on Wall Street. Schwed shows that most of the forecasts and predictions made by Wall Street experts are worthless and inaccurate. They are often based on faulty assumptions, incomplete data, or wishful thinking. They are also influenced by emotions, biases, and herd mentality. They are constantly revised and contradicted by new events and information.
 
Schwed advises investors to ignore the forecasts and predictions made by Wall Street experts. He argues that they are not only useless but also harmful. They can mislead investors into making wrong decisions, chasing fads, or missing opportunities. He also suggests that investors should focus on the present and the past, rather than the future. He says: "The future is never clear; you pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus."
 
## The Importance of Humor
 
A final theme of the book is the importance of humor on Wall Street. Schwed shows that humor is a powerful weapon against the follies and hypocrisies of Wall Street. Humor can expose the absurdity and irrationality of Wall Street. Humor can also relieve the stress and anxiety of investing. Humor can also help investors maintain a healthy perspective and attitude towards money and life.
 
Schwed advises investors to cultivate a sense of humor when dealing with Wall Street. He argues that humor can help investors cope with the uncertainties and risks of investing. He also suggests that investors should not take themselves or Wall Street too seriously. He says: "There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures."
