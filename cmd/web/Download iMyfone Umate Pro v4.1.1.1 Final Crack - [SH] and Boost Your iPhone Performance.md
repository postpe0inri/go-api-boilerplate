It brings new features and improvements such as a dark mode for File Explorer, a cloud clipboard, a new screenshot tool, and more. If you are an advanced user and want to install the update manually, you will need a serial key to activate it. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the Windows 10 October 2018 Update ISO file from the Microsoft website or a trusted source.
2. Burn the ISO file to a DVD or create a bootable USB drive using a tool like Rufus.
3. Boot your computer from the DVD or USB drive and follow the instructions to install Windows 10.
4. When prompted, enter the serial key that you obtained from a legitimate source. You can also use a generic key for testing purposes, but you will need to activate Windows 10 later with a valid key.
5. Enjoy the new features and enhancements of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update.

Note: Before installing the update, make sure your device meets the minimum system requirements and backup your important data.

You can also wait for the update to be offered to your device automatically through Windows Update, which will ensure a smooth and safe update experience.
