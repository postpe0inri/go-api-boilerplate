# A.K.Tayal Engineering Mechanics: A Comprehensive Guide for Students and Professionals
 
Engineering mechanics is a branch of science that deals with the behavior of physical bodies under the action of forces. It is a fundamental subject for engineering students and professionals, as it provides the basis for understanding and designing various structures, machines, and systems. Engineering mechanics can be divided into two main branches: statics and dynamics.

Statics is the study of forces and their effects on bodies at rest or in equilibrium. Dynamics is the study of forces and their effects on bodies in motion. Both branches require the application of basic concepts such as force, mass, acceleration, momentum, energy, work, power, torque, and moment of inertia. Engineering mechanics also involves the use of mathematical tools such as vectors, matrices, differential equations, and calculus to solve problems.
 
A.K.Tayal is a renowned author and professor of mechanical engineering who has written several books on engineering mechanics. His books are widely used by students and professionals alike for their clarity, rigor, and comprehensiveness. His books cover both statics and dynamics in depth, with numerous examples, exercises, and illustrations. His books also include topics such as friction, virtual work, kinematics, kinetics, impulse-momentum, impact, vibration, and rigid body motion.
 
One of his most popular books is Engineering Mechanics: Statics and Dynamics[^2^], which was published by Unmesh Publications in 2000. The book has 11 editions and 688 pages. It covers all the topics of engineering mechanics in a systematic and logical manner. The book also has a companion volume called Engineering Mechanics: Problems and Solutions[^3^], which contains solved problems for each chapter of the main book.
