# 4m Fine Fire 14000: The Ultimate Fire Extinguisher for Your Home
 
Fire is one of the most common and dangerous hazards in any home. According to the [National Fire Protection Association](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/US-Fire-Problem/Home-Fires), there were an estimated 379,600 home fires in the United States in 2018, resulting in 2,770 civilian deaths and 11,650 civilian injuries. That's why every homeowner should have a reliable fire extinguisher at hand.
 
But not all fire extinguishers are created equal. Some are too heavy, too bulky, or too complicated to use. Some have a short range, low capacity, or limited effectiveness. Some may even cause more damage than the fire itself.

## How Does the 4m Fine Fire 14000 Work?
 
The 4m Fine Fire 14000 uses a patented technology called *Fine Fire*, which consists of microscopic water droplets that are sprayed at high pressure and speed. These droplets have a high surface area and low volume, which means they can absorb more heat and oxygen from the fire than conventional water or foam. They also create a cooling effect that prevents re-ignition and minimizes smoke and damage.
 
The 4m Fine Fire 14000 has a simple and intuitive operation. All you have to do is pull the safety pin, aim the nozzle at the base of the fire, and squeeze the trigger. The nozzle has a rotating head that allows you to adjust the spray pattern from jet to mist depending on the size and type of the fire. The tank has a transparent window that shows you how much water is left.
